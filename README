The NASA Tensegrity Robotics Toolkit (NTRT) is a collection of C++ and
MATLAB software modules for the modeling, simulation, and control of
Tensegrity Robots. The NTRT Simulator is a tensegrity-specific simulator
built to run ontop of the Bullet Physics Engine, version 2.82.

See INSTALL for instructions on how to install the library and build
from source.

The most accessable examples of tensegrity structures are in the
examples directory. Additional examples can be found in folders
"models controllers and apps" or in dev/tests and dev/btietz.
