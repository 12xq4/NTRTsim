Some notes during the process of creating the groundforcesensor functionality.
-Drew Sabelhaus 2016-08-02

First, find out exactly how the tgBasicActuator and friends are created.

-----------------------------
Notes about the classes themselves:

tgSpringCableActuator
	constructor requires a tgSpringCable reference to be passed in

tgSpringCable
	does NOT inherent from anything
	does NOT contain references to any underlying Bullet classes
	but, does have a list of tgSpringCableAnchor .
	
tgBulletSpringCable
	inherets from tgSpringCable, is a type of tgSringCable
	FORMERLY KNOWN AS muscle2p
	this is the class that applies a force to the anchors!

-----------------------------
What I will need to do:

FOR THE COMPRESSION SPRING ITSELF:
Create the classes:

tgCompressionSpring (equivalent to tgSpringCable)
	not-quite-abstract class that defines the behavior of a compression spring
	just like tgSpringCable, but with requirements about pos/neg of spring constants to be flipped etc.

tgBulletCompressionSpring (equivalent to tgBulletSpringCable)
	just like tgBulletSpringCable. Might actually be almost exactly the same code.

TO CHECK:
   can we re-use tgSpringCableAnchor and tgBulletSpringCableAnchor?
       Probably. In particular, tgBulletSpringCableAnchor refers to a btRigidBody directly, and
       since our world is a btRigidBody, then it could attach.
       Additionally, we may not even need two anchors for our ground force sensor: the sensor could
       just have a reference to its own non-moving point in space (a btVector3) as the anchor of the spring.
