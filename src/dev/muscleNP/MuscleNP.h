/**
 * An extension of Muscle2P that places a ghostObject into the bullet world
 * and then uses that object to generate collision dynamics. The
 * ghost object is updated every time step to account for the new
 * shape of the string. Anchors track their associated btPersistentManifold
 * to determine whether they are still in contact with the rigid object. The string
 * is massless, but collision handling should conserve momentum (see unit tests)
 * 
 * This could eventually be merged with Corde for a massive, low node
 * string. Merging with Corde could also address some of the current
 * issues with rotational energy
