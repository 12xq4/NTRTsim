Contribute to Docs
===================

This section contains details on contributing to NTRT's documentation.

Install Sphinx
---------------

NTRT's docs are written using Sphinx. So first you'll need to ensure you have Sphinx installed. You can learn more here:

Modifying NTRT's Docs
----------------------

NTRTSim's Sphinx documentation can be found in the docs/source directory.

Once you've made your desired changes, double check that they throw no errors on generation. You can generate HTML documentation by running **make html** in the **doc** folder. Note that documentation is generated from the master branch; any time documentation changes hit the master branch, the documentation is re-generated.
