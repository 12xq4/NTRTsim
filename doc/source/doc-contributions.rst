Modifying NTRT's Docs
-----

NTRTSim's Sphinx documentation can be found in the docs/source directory.

Once you've made your desired changes, double check that they throw no errors on generation. You can generate HTML documentation by running **make html** in doc/. Once you've verified that your documentation has no errors, push it to NTRT's. Once your doc modifications are pushed to the master branch a set of up-to-date docs will be generated.
